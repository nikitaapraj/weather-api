# API DOCUMENTATION FOR NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE API

*I've created this documentation as a personal project. The official documentation for the NWS API is [here](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).*

Tools used:
* Postman (to test the API endpoints and create examples)
* Visual Studio Code (for writing the docs in Markdown)
* GitHub Desktop (for branching and version control)
